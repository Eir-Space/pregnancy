# Eir Space Pregnancy Skill

`pregnancy` is a condition/event skill for managing pregnancy-specific information in `pregnancy.md` while keeping `health.md` synchronized.

It helps an agent:
- maintain pregnancy context for future answers
- ask high-value pregnancy follow-up questions
- store detailed pregnancy information in `pregnancy.md`
- sync `health.md` (`Active Health Contexts`, `Skill Attachments`, `Linked Health Files`)
